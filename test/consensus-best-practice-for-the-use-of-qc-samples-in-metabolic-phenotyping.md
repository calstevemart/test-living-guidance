# CONSENSUS BEST PRACTICE FOR THE USE OF QC SAMPLES IN METABOLIC PHENOTYPING

### WARNING

Do whatever you like, ignore the following guidance&#x20;

### Quality Control samples&#x20;

Quality control (QC) samples provide an essential element of assuring data quality in the untargeted analysis of endogenous metabolites. There are different types of QC samples.&#x20;

&#x20;

### Pooled Quality Control Samples &#x20;

Current practice in metabolomics/metabonomics is to prepare matrix-based QC’s that a representative of the sample type being analysed. Common practice is to use some form of 'pooled' matrix, generally comprised of mixtures of aliquots of the samples under study but, where this is impractical, bulk matrix samples of the matrix obtained from other sources may be employed. The various types of QC sample currently employed are described below. &#x20;

### Types of pooled QC&#x20;

**Pooled QC** samples are generally a bulk matrix-matched sample, usually prepared by mixing aliquots from all the samples in the study. In the case of large studies, the pooled QC may be prepared from a subset of the samples or alternatively a non-study-related “bulk” sample of the matrix. &#x20;

**Phenotypic** pooled QC samples a formed by pooling matrix-matched sets of the individual phenotypes/classes of samples studied (e.g. test and control) prepared separately in addition to the standard pooled  QC sample. It can be used to highlight differences in precision in test vs control samples for signals differentiating between the classes. &#x20;

**Intra-study QC** samples, which can include intra batch/within-batch and inter-batch/between -batch QCs are used to assess the precision of untargeted data along a single analytical batch of samples (intra-batch QC) or for a single study that is analyzed in several analytical batches  (inter-batch QC). It can be a pooled QC prepared from aliquots of the samples analyzed in the batch itself (see above) or, where this is impractical can be e.g., a “bulk” QC sample of the same matrix.&#x20;

**Long term QCs**  represent a reference material prepared from a set of samples, or a bulk sample/reference material purchased from a public source designed to be used in all analyses of the that matrix in a laboratory. Thes Long term QCs  can be used to monitor analytical performance over long periods for both intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility. Long term QCs  may be used to assess (and potentially correct for) any differences between separate studies on the same type of sample over long periods of the use of the analytical method. &#x20;

**Intra-laboratory QC** samples are used as within-lab QC samples and are used only within a single laboratory. &#x20;

**Inter-laboratory QC** samples are used between-laboratories to compare data/analytical performance between two or more labs. &#x20;

### Preparation of QC’s&#x20;

**Cells**&#x20;

**Cell Culture Media**&#x20;

**Biological fluids**&#x20;

**Tissues**&#x20;

**Semi-solid samples (e.g., faeces)**&#x20;

**Plant-based material?**&#x20;

**Give methodology optimized for LC- MS (and NMR spectroscopy -in later version)**&#x20;

**Classes of samples; liquid/solid/semi-solid – make sure to include food, environmental**&#x20;

All illustrated with flow charts?&#x20;

Use of QC’s in the analysis of samples&#x20;

### System suitability? &#x20;

System conditioning&#x20;

Include other uses as we had in pooled QC topic (from slide at Metabolomics 2022)&#x20;

### Ratio of QC’s to samples? &#x20;

QC Frequency during the run (with diagrams of plate layouts etc)&#x20;

QC redundancy&#x20;

QC acceptance criteria&#x20;

&#x20;

### Examples of best practice &#x20;

Reporting  ( from reporting manuscript and related resources relating to pooled QC)&#x20;

Within publications&#x20;

QC data submission to databanks&#x20;
